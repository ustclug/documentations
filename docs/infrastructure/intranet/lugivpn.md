# LUG Intranet VPN

service: intranet.ustclug.org

server: board.s.ustclug.org

## Introduction

Server intranet is a closed network, which cannot be accessed from Internet. LUGI VPN helps maintainer get access to intranet temporarily.

LUGI VPN is running in ~~Banana Pi~~ Raspberry Pi 3B+, the only ARM architecture device we owned. Using OpenVPN protocal, authorizing via LDAP.

The original Banana Pi was down in April 2021.

## Configuration

OpenVPN LDAP auth plugin config `/etc/openvpn/auth-ldap.conf`:

```
<LDAP>
	URL             ldaps://ldap.ustclug.org
	Timeout         15
	FollowReferrals yes
	TLSCACertFile   /etc/ldap/ssl/slapd-ca-cert.pem
</LDAP>

<Authorization>
	BaseDN          "ou=people,dc=lug,dc=ustc,dc=edu,dc=cn"
	SearchFilter    "(uid=%u)"
	RequireGroup    false
</Authorization>
```

In openvpn configuration:

```
...
plugin /usr/lib/openvpn/openvpn-auth-ldap.so /etc/openvpn/auth-ldap.conf
```

Servers intranet is a layer 2 network without default gateway. So NAT is needed:

```sh
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.254.248.0/22 -d 10.254.0.0/21 -j MASQUERADE
```
