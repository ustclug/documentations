# LUG @ USTC Documentation

Documentation for LUG @ USTC technical infrastructure.

## Layout

Our documentation is divided into these sections, as laid out on the left navigation menu:

- The **Workflow** section provides guidance to (a few) common maintenance tasks.
- The **Infrastructure** section describes our infrastructure, as well as common configurations across different servers (networking, firewalls, security, monitoring, etc.).
- The **Services** section documents specific configurations on individual servers and service units (software and/or Docker containers).
- The **Common Issues** (a.k.a. **FAQ**) section records our troubleshooting experiences and serves partially as a "notebook" for known traps and workarounds.
